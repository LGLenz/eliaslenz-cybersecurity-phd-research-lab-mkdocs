This repository hosts the documentation site for my part-time PhD in Cyber
Security (University of Plymouth), focused on **policy-as-code (PaC) guardrails**
and human-centric security governance.

Because this is directly tied to an ongoing doctoral project, external code
contributions are limited. However, you are very welcome to:

- open issues suggesting clarifications or corrections
- point to related literature, standards, or case studies
- give feedback on the clarity and structure of the documentation

If you are interested in collaboration (e.g. joint publications, case studies,
tooling experiments), please reach out via:

- the freelance site: https://elb-consulting-tech.github.io/eliaslenz-secure-consulting/
- or via the contact options listed there.
