# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please **do not** open a public issue with exploit details.

Instead, contact the maintainer privately (see `docs/contact.md`) with:

- steps to reproduce
- impact assessment
- suggested fix (optional)

## Disclosure
Coordinated disclosure is preferred. Public disclosure may occur after a fix is available.
