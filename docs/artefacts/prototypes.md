# Prototypes & tooling

This section summarises the main prototype strands related to the PhD.

## SecureLaunch WebHub – sample dashboard

A static demonstration of a security & governance dashboard is available via
the freelance site:

- **Sample dashboard (static):**  
  https://elb-consulting-tech.github.io/eliaslenz-secure-consulting/sample/dist/index.html

The public version is intentionally static and anonymised, but illustrates how:

- guardrails and controls can be surfaced to stakeholders
- incident signals and coverage can be reasoned about
- technical details can be summarised for decision-makers

## Policy-as-code guardrails

Planned and ongoing work includes:

- expressing selected governance requirements as PaC rules
- grouping and tagging guardrails for different audiences and contexts
- assessing LLM-assisted authoring and refactoring of guardrails
- exploring feedback channels (dashboards, reports, PR comments)

Where appropriate, generic or anonymised artefacts may be published either via
this lab site or attached to working papers.

## Tooling ecosystem

The broader tooling landscape may include:

- IaC scanning tools (e.g. for Terraform/Kubernetes)
- policy engines (e.g. OPA/Rego) and guardrail frameworks
- SBOM and dependency analysis tools
- experiment notebooks and simple web dashboards

The goal is not to build a monolithic tool, but to understand and document how
guardrails can be introduced in realistic environments.
