# Methodology & design

The project follows a **design-science inspired** methodology, combining
conceptual work with artefact design and evaluation.

## 1. Problem exploration

- analyse regulatory, organisational and technical constraints
- refine research questions iteratively with supervisors
- map current practices in cloud security governance and PaC usage

## 2. Conceptual modelling

- define a conceptual model for human-centric guardrails
- relate policies, actors, evidence and decision flows
- link to existing frameworks and norms (e.g. NIS2, BSI guidance)

## 3. Artefact design & implementation

- candidate guardrails and policy sets (PaC)
- supporting documentation and explanation patterns
- dashboard-style visualisations and reporting components
- automation hooks (CI/CD, scanning, runtime checks)

## 4. Evaluation

- scenario walk-throughs with practitioners
- small-scale experiments or case studies where feasible
- reflection on organisational fit and human factors

## 5. Iteration

- refine guardrails, documentation and automation based on findings
- feed lessons back into both research and practice settings

The **SecureLaunch WebHub** sample dashboard (hosted via the freelance site)
serves as a communication artefact for some of these ideas.
