# Literature review

The literature review weaves together several strands:

- cloud security and assurance for PaaS/IaaS
- governance, risk and compliance (GRC) practices
- policy-as-code (PaC) and infrastructure-as-code (IaC)
- human factors in security and compliance
- explainability and transparency in automated decision systems

The review is supported by:

- structured mapping tables (CSV) for key publications
- curated reference collections (BibTeX / Markdown)
- early synthesis work feeding into the CPS cybersecurity preprint

## Artefacts available in this repo

This repo includes local, version-controlled copies of the key artefacts:

- **Preprint 1 – CPS cybersecurity (HTML):** [Open](../papers/preprint-1.html)
- **Guardrails matrix (CSV):** [Download](../papers/guardrails_matrix.csv)
- **PaC guardrails references (BibTeX):** [Download](../papers/pac_guardrails_refs.bib)

An external copy of the preprint is also hosted on the consulting site:

## Objectives

The objectives of the review are to identify:

- where PaC is used mainly as a tooling convenience, with limited governance
  integration
- where governance frameworks lack operationalised, testable artefacts
- patterns for making complex controls understandable to non-specialists
