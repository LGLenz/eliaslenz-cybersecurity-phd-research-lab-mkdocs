# Comparative synthesis: Germany/UK vs Kenya/Malaysia

This page is a living synthesis of literature and practice patterns across:

- **Germany (public sector, Baden‑Württemberg)**  
- **United Kingdom (public sector / NCSC patterns)**
- **Kenya**
- **Malaysia**

## Themes (starter)

1. Migration governance & procurement
2. Skills, training, and organisational learning
3. Security controls & assurance (identity, network, data)
4. Compliance regimes and auditability
5. Vendor lock‑in and sovereignty constraints
6. Incident response and operational resilience

> Populate each theme with cited findings and explicitly contrast the four contexts.
