# Kenya & Malaysia capture template

This template is designed to keep your Kenya/Malaysia expansion **systematic, auditable, and directly traceable** to your research questions.

## How to use
1. Export new items from Zotero to `docs/references/library.bib` (Better BibTeX recommended).
2. For each Kenya/Malaysia-relevant source, add one row to `docs/artefacts/kenya_malaysia_capture_template.csv`.
3. When you have ~10–20 rows, we can generate:
   - a Kenya synthesis,
   - a Malaysia synthesis,
   - and a comparative section that slots into your literature chapter.

## Evidence strength rubric (suggested)
- **A (Strong):** peer‑reviewed empirical study or official standard/guidance with operational detail
- **B (Moderate):** peer‑reviewed conceptual paper or high‑quality government report with some operational detail
- **C (Weak):** blog/vendor material used only for context; must be triangulated
- **D (Exclude):** unverifiable provenance or purely promotional
