# Consulting bridge – linking research and practice

This page explains how the PhD research lab connects to my small,
research-aligned freelance consulting practice.

## Freelance consulting site

The consulting site is hosted separately as a static site:

- **Freelance site:**  
  https://elb-consulting-tech.github.io/eliaslenz-secure-consulting/

It focuses on:

- Linux hardening and secure configuration
- AI-assisted secure software and DevSecOps workflows
- policy-as-code and governance advisory
- academic and application support services for non-EU applicants to German universities

## Shared artefacts

Some artefacts are intentionally shared:

- **SecureLaunch WebHub** – sample dashboard  
  https://elb-consulting-tech.github.io/eliaslenz-secure-consulting/sample/dist/index.html

- **Preprint 1 – CPS cybersecurity (HTML)**  
  Working paper on threats, vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms in CPS,
  with attached CSV/BibTeX artefacts:  
  https://elb-consulting-tech.github.io/eliaslenz-secure-consulting/papers/preprint-1.html

These are clearly labelled as research-oriented artefacts on the consulting site.

## Rationale

Separating the research lab and consulting site, while linking them explicitly,
allows for:

- clear boundaries between academic work and freelance services
- a controlled way to trial ideas from the PhD in practice
- transparency for supervisors, reviewers and clients

This page is intended to make those relationships explicit.
