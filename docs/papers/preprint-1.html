  <p><em>Working draft for PhD literature repository (not directly tied to core thesis RQs). This document is being iteratively refined using peer‑reviewed and authoritative sources.</em></p>

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>
    Rapid digitalisation has expanded the attack surface of organisations across sectors, especially in
    Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, cyber‑physical systems (CPS) and small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs).
    This narrative review synthesises recent peer‑reviewed and authoritative literature on cyber threats,
    vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms in these domains. Drawing on threat‑landscape reports such as the
    ENISA Threat Landscape 2023 and empirical studies on SME security posture, it highlights how ransomware,
    phishing, supply‑chain compromise and false‑data injection attacks increasingly target interconnected
    industrial systems and resource‑constrained organisations.
    The review distinguishes between structural and human‑centric vulnerabilities, emphasising misconfigurations,
    legacy system integration, weak access control, inadequate monitoring and low security awareness as
    cross‑cutting issues. It further compares model‑based detection techniques (e.g. Kalman‑filter‑based secure
    state estimation in CPS) with data‑driven and hybrid approaches using machine learning and anomaly detection.
    Finally, the paper identifies research gaps around cross‑domain datasets, explainable detection for safety‑
    critical systems, SME‑appropriate controls and the integration of technical defences with governance and
    human‑centric measures such as training and usable security. The findings motivate a multi‑layered research
    agenda that links detection, resilience engineering and security culture.

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Cybersecurity has become a critical concern for organisations of all sizes as digital technologies are
    embedded into physical processes, supply chains and public services. Contemporary infrastructures increasingly
    rely on interconnected sensors, cloud platforms and automation technologies to enable Industry&nbsp;4.0
    production lines, smart grids, intelligent transport systems and digital service delivery. While these
    developments offer substantial efficiency and innovation benefits, they also introduce new vulnerabilities and
    expose organisations to sophisticated cyber threats that can disrupt operations, compromise safety and erode
    public trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evidence from recent threat‑landscape studies indicates a sustained rise in ransomware, phishing and
    data‑exfiltration campaigns, alongside targeted attacks on operational technology and CPS in sectors such as
    energy, manufacturing and health care. At the same time, SMEs remain disproportionately affected by
    commodity attacks and social‑engineering campaigns due to limited resources, skills shortages and fragmented
    governance structures. In parallel, advanced adversaries increasingly exploit the tight coupling of cyber and
    physical components through false‑data injection, replay attacks and supply‑chain compromises aimed at
    industrial control systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this background, understanding how threats, vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms differ – and
    overlap – across Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, CPS and SMEs is essential for designing effective mitigation
    strategies. Rather than treating these domains in isolation, this review adopts a cross‑domain perspective
    that emphasises common patterns in attacker behaviour, systemic weaknesses and defensive responses. The
    objective is to provide a structured synthesis that can inform both future research and practice, including
    the design of human‑centric, governance‑aware security architectures.
  </p>

  <h2>1.1 Scope and Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    This working paper focuses on three interrelated domains:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Industry&nbsp;4.0</strong> – networked production systems, industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices,
      manufacturing execution systems and related cloud/edge components.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cyber‑physical systems (CPS)</strong> – safety‑critical systems that tightly couple computation,
      communication and physical processes, such as smart grids, autonomous vehicles and industrial control
      systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs)</strong> – organisations with limited dedicated security
      staff and budgets, often relying on third‑party platforms and managed services for IT and security.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The paper has three main contributions. First, it consolidates recent evidence on the dominant threats and
    exploited vulnerabilities across these domains, including both technical and human factors. Second, it
    compares model‑based, data‑driven and hybrid defence mechanisms, with a particular focus on intrusion
    detection and anomaly‑detection approaches applicable to Industry&nbsp;4.0 and CPS. Third, it identifies
    cross‑cutting research gaps and practice‑oriented challenges, such as the scarcity of high‑quality
    cross‑domain datasets, limited attention to SMEs in advanced detection research, and the need to integrate
    technical safeguards with governance and user‑centric interventions such as training and security culture.
  </p>

  <h2>1.2 Review Method</h2>
  <p>
    This study follows a structured narrative review approach rather than a full systematic review. The goal is to
    synthesise key trends and representative mechanisms across several rapidly evolving sub‑fields while
    maintaining enough flexibility to incorporate both peer‑reviewed academic work and authoritative practitioner
    reports. The review proceeded in three stages.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Search and selection.</strong> Core literature was identified using databases such as IEEE Xplore,
      ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink and Scopus. Search strings combined terms related to
      threats (e.g. "ransomware", "false data injection", "replay attacks"), context domains ("Industry 4.0",
      "cyber‑physical systems", "industrial control systems", "SMEs") and defence mechanisms ("intrusion
      detection", "anomaly detection", "Kalman filter", "machine learning"). The time window emphasised
      publications from approximately 2015 onwards, with earlier foundational work included where necessary to
      explain key concepts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inclusion and exclusion criteria.</strong> Included studies were (a) peer‑reviewed journal articles,
      conference papers or book chapters, or (b) authoritative reports from recognised institutions such as
      NIST and ENISA. Work focusing purely on cryptographic primitives without system context, non‑cyber criminal
      activity, or high‑level management commentary without technical or socio‑technical detail was excluded.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Data extraction and synthesis.</strong> For each selected source, information about the domain
      (Industry&nbsp;4.0, CPS, SMEs), threat type, exploited vulnerabilities, defence mechanism and evaluation
      method was recorded. Findings were then grouped thematically to derive cross‑domain patterns in threats and
      vulnerabilities and to compare model‑based, data‑driven and hybrid defence approaches.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The review is further informed by recent threat‑landscape publications, including ENISA's Threat Landscape
    2023 series and NIST guidance on cloud security and cyber‑physical systems, as well as empirical studies of
    cybersecurity awareness and capability in SMEs and developing‑country contexts. These sources complement the
    academic literature by providing up‑to‑date insights into attacker behaviour, incident trends and
    organisational constraints.

  <h2>2. Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
  <p>
    This section outlines the dominant cyber threats affecting Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, cyber‑physical systems
    (CPS) and small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs). The analysis draws on recent threat‑landscape
    publications, particularly the ENISA Threat Landscape 2023 report, which highlights ransomware, data breaches,
    business email compromise, distributed denial‑of‑service (DDoS) attacks and supply‑chain compromise as
    recurring top‑tier threats across sectors, including industrial and critical‑infrastructure contexts
    (<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ENISA, 2023</a>). These findings are combined with domain‑specific
    academic studies to distinguish how similar threat families manifest differently across industrial, CPS and
    SME settings.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Threats in Industry&nbsp;4.0 Environments</h3>
  <p>
    Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments integrate operational technology (OT), industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    devices, cloud services and advanced analytics. This convergence expands the attack surface and blurs
    boundaries between IT and OT networks. Survey and review studies indicate that common threats include
    ransomware and other malware targeting production systems, unauthorised remote access, DDoS attacks on
    industrial control systems, and manipulation of process data in smart manufacturing environments
    (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361519304427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sadeghzadeh et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>;
    <a href="https://journals.ardascience.com/index.php/dss/article/view/188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akinrolabu and New, 2022</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    ENISA identifies several Industry&nbsp;4.0‑specific challenges, including exploitation of insecure IIoT devices,
    weak network segmentation between IT and OT, and unpatched legacy systems that cannot easily be updated due to
    availability and safety constraints
    (<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/Industry%204.0%20-%20Cybersecurity%20Challenges%20and%20Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ENISA, 2019</a>). Attackers may leverage these weaknesses to
    move laterally from enterprise networks into production lines, disrupt operations through cryptolocker
    ransomware, or exfiltrate intellectual property. The high interconnectedness of supply chains further
    introduces risks from compromised vendors and managed service providers, including attacks propagated via
    software updates or remote‑maintenance channels
    (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/11/1864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sadeghi et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Threats in Cyber‑Physical Systems</h3>
  <p>
    CPS combine sensing, computation, communication and actuation to control physical processes in domains such as
    smart grids, transportation and industrial automation. Beyond generic IT threats such as malware and
    unauthorised access, CPS are particularly exposed to attacks that manipulate sensor measurements or control
    commands. False‑data injection (FDI) attacks aim to corrupt measurement data in ways that remain undetected by
    conventional bad‑data detection, potentially causing unsafe control decisions. Several surveys document how FDI
    attacks can destabilise smart grids, interfere with state estimation and conceal power‑flow manipulations
    (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212619310713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liu et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>;
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-58672-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zhang and Sankar, 2020</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to FDI, CPS face replay attacks, where previously recorded legitimate measurements or commands are
    resent to mislead controllers, as well as covert attacks that remain stealthy by carefully coordinating the
    timing and magnitude of injected signals
    (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109820303150" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teixeira et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>;
    <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109823001097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ciaramella et&nbsp;al., 2023</a>). If successful, such attacks can lead to
    cascading failures or physical damage while evading simple threshold‑based alarms. Because CPS often operate in
    safety‑critical contexts, even low‑frequency but high‑impact attacks are of serious concern, and incident
    response is constrained by real‑time and safety requirements.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Threats Faced by Small and Medium‑Sized Enterprises</h3>
  <p>
    SMEs experience many of the same threat families as larger organisations but are disproportionately affected by
    commodity attacks and social engineering. Systematic reviews and empirical studies report that ransomware,
    phishing and business email compromise are among the most prevalent threats, frequently leading to financial
    loss, data breaches and operational disruption
    (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/15/6909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nurse et&nbsp;al., 2021</a>;
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17186v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naiakshina et&nbsp;al., 2023</a>).
    ENISA's threat‑landscape reporting similarly observes that ransomware operators increasingly target
    resource‑constrained organisations, including SMEs, due to their reliance on standard platforms and limited
    security controls
    (<a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/ENISA%20Threat%20Landscape%202023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ENISA, 2023</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Studies of SME cybersecurity risk management highlight low levels of security awareness, underinvestment in
    dedicated security staff, and reliance on external providers as key enabling factors for successful attacks
    (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/21582440251314671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hassan et&nbsp;al., 2024</a>;
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bob-Duncan/publication/342933159_Cybersecurity_Risk_Management_in_Small_and_Medium-Sized_Enterprises_A_Systematic_Review_of_Recent_Evidence/links/6050d580458515e8344e4796/Cybersecurity-Risk-Management-in-Small-and-Medium-Sized-Enterprises-A-Systematic-Review-of-Recent-Evidence.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Duncan et&nbsp;al., 2020</a>).
    Attackers commonly exploit weak password practices, lack of multi‑factor authentication, misconfigured remote
    access services and unpatched software. Phishing campaigns and malicious attachments remain dominant vectors
    for initial compromise, often resulting in ransomware deployment or credential theft, as echoed in ENISA and
    ISACA analyses of ransomware campaigns
    (<a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2023/volume-2/enisas-threat-landscape-and-the-effect-of-ransomware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paganini, 2023</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>2.4 Comparative View Across Domains</h3>
  <p>
    Comparing these domains reveals both shared and domain‑specific threat patterns. Ransomware, phishing and
    credential theft are pervasive across Industry&nbsp;4.0 operators, CPS environments and SMEs, reflecting the
    continued effectiveness of social engineering and exploitation of basic security weaknesses. Supply‑chain
    attacks and remote‑access abuse increasingly affect industrial environments as OT systems become reachable from
    IT networks and cloud‑based management platforms. At the same time, CPS‑specific threats such as FDI and
    replay attacks exploit the tight coupling between cyber and physical processes and require domain knowledge to
    execute effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    SMEs are exposed to many of the same threat actors but often via commoditised attack tools and
    "off‑the‑shelf" ransomware‑as‑a‑service offerings, whereas large industrial operators may face more targeted
    campaigns, including advanced persistent threats seeking long‑term access or strategic disruption. The
    cross‑domain comparison underscores that while the technical sophistication of attacks may vary, many incidents
    originate from common weaknesses such as poor credential hygiene, inadequate patching and insufficient
    monitoring. These observations motivate the subsequent analysis of vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Vulnerabilities in Cyber Systems</h2>
  <p>
    While threats describe adversarial goals and attack patterns, vulnerabilities capture the weaknesses that
    enable such threats to materialise. In the contexts considered here, vulnerabilities arise from the
    interaction of technical design decisions, architectural constraints, legacy dependencies and human and
    organisational factors. This section distinguishes vulnerabilities observed in Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments,
    CPS and SMEs before drawing out cross‑cutting issues such as misconfigurations, legacy integration and
    supply‑chain exposure.
  </p>

  <h3>3.1 Vulnerabilities in Industry&nbsp;4.0 Environments</h3>
  <p>
    Industry&nbsp;4.0 implementations typically interconnect sensors, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human–
    machine interfaces (HMIs), industrial robots, manufacturing execution systems and cloud‑based analytics
    platforms. This convergence is often achieved by incrementally layering new components on top of established
    OT infrastructures rather than through a clean‑slate redesign. As a result, modern production networks
    frequently combine legacy fieldbuses and proprietary protocols with IP‑based communication and remote access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Empirical studies and security assessments highlight several recurring vulnerabilities in such environments.
    First, legacy OT devices may lack basic security features such as authentication, encryption and secure
    firmware update mechanisms. They were designed for closed networks and high availability, not for exposure to
    the public internet or cloud services. Second, insufficient network segmentation between IT and OT domains,
    or flat network architectures within the OT domain, allow attackers to move laterally once an initial foothold
    is obtained. Third, insecure or poorly managed remote‑access mechanisms – for example VPNs, remote‑desktop
    solutions or vendor maintenance channels – provide direct paths into production environments when
    misconfigured or unmonitored.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, the integration of IIoT sensors and actuators introduces a large number of low‑cost devices that
    may not receive timely security updates and are sometimes deployed with default credentials or weak access
    controls. Configuration drift, incomplete asset inventories and the coexistence of multiple vendor‑specific
    management tools further complicate patch management and incident response. These vulnerabilities create
    opportunities for ransomware propagation, unauthorised command execution and subtle manipulation of production
    parameters.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 Vulnerabilities in Cyber‑Physical Systems</h3>
  <p>
    In CPS, vulnerabilities relate not only to conventional software and network weaknesses but also to the
    physical dynamics of controlled processes. False‑data injection and replay attacks exploit the dependence of
    control algorithms on sensor readings and model‑based state estimation. For example, if an attacker gains
    access to measurement channels or remote terminal units, they may manipulate or delay sensor data in ways
    that remain statistically plausible to standard bad‑data detectors, thereby misleading state estimators and
    controllers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several technical and architectural factors facilitate such attacks. Limited authentication and integrity
    protection for measurement and control channels, especially in older SCADA deployments, allow adversaries to
    tamper with messages in transit. Redundancy and diversity mechanisms may be absent or incorrectly configured,
    so that compromised measurements disproportionately influence state estimation. Time‑synchronisation
    vulnerabilities can also be exploited to desynchronise control loops or to align replayed measurements with
    expected timestamps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond communication channels, vulnerabilities can arise from imperfect system models and parameter
    uncertainties. If the model used for control and intrusion detection does not accurately reflect the true
    system dynamics, attackers can craft disturbances that exploit this mismatch to remain undetected. Resource
    constraints on embedded controllers and sensors may limit the complexity of onboard security mechanisms,
    creating trade‑offs between performance, safety and security. Finally, many CPS operate continuously and are
    costly to shut down, which can delay patching and security upgrades and extend the lifetime of known
    vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <h3>3.3 Vulnerabilities in Small and Medium‑Sized Enterprises</h3>
  <p>
    SMEs often rely on commodity hardware, off‑the‑shelf software and cloud‑hosted services to support their
    business processes. From a technical perspective, common vulnerabilities include outdated operating systems
    and applications, weak password policies, lack of multi‑factor authentication, exposed remote‑desktop services
    and unpatched web applications. Misconfigurations in cloud accounts – such as publicly accessible storage
    buckets, overly permissive access policies or neglected audit logging – further widen the attack surface.
  </p>
  <p>
    Human and organisational factors play a particularly prominent role in SME vulnerability profiles. Limited
    access to dedicated security staff means that security responsibilities are frequently distributed across
    generalist IT personnel or even non‑technical staff. Security awareness training may be ad‑hoc or absent, and
    processes for change management, access review and incident response are often informal. This can lead to
    inconsistent application of security controls, delayed patching and weak monitoring. Reliance on third‑party
    managed‑service providers and software vendors introduces additional dependencies, where vulnerabilities in
    suppliers' systems or support tools can cascade into SME environments.
  </p>

  <h3>3.4 Cross‑Domain and Supply‑Chain Vulnerabilities</h3>
  <p>
    Despite domain‑specific characteristics, several vulnerability themes recur across Industry&nbsp;4.0, CPS and
    SMEs. Misconfigurations in identity and access management, network segmentation and security monitoring are
    pervasive, reflecting the complexity of modern architectures and the challenges of maintaining consistent
    configurations over time. Legacy systems that cannot easily be patched or redesigned create long‑lived
    exposure, particularly in industrial and CPS contexts where availability and safety requirements constrain
    maintenance windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Supply‑chain dependencies are another shared source of vulnerability. Organisations increasingly depend on
    third‑party software components, libraries, cloud platforms and managed services. Compromise of these
    dependencies – for example through malicious updates, vulnerabilities in widely used libraries or abuse of
    remote‑management tools – can have widespread impact. In Industry&nbsp;4.0 and CPS, vendor‑supplied engineering
    workstations, configuration tools and remote‑maintenance channels are critical assets whose compromise may
    grant deep access to production systems. SMEs, in turn, may have limited visibility into the security
    practices of their providers and may lack the leverage to demand stronger assurances.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, human factors and governance cut across all three domains. Incomplete asset inventories, unclear
    ownership of security responsibilities, weak enforcement of policies and limited security culture all
    contribute to persistent vulnerabilities. These issues underscore the need for defence strategies that combine
    technical controls with governance mechanisms and capacity building, which are examined in the next section.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Defence Mechanisms and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    Defence mechanisms against cyber threats in Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, CPS and SMEs span several layers,
    from preventive hardening and secure‑by‑design engineering through to intrusion detection, incident response
    and organisational controls. This section distinguishes model‑based, data‑driven and hybrid technical
    approaches, and then discusses SME‑appropriate and governance‑aligned mitigation strategies. The emphasis is
    on mechanisms that can reduce the likelihood and impact of attacks such as ransomware, false‑data injection,
    phishing and supply‑chain compromise while accounting for domain‑specific constraints.
  </p>

  <h3>4.1 Model‑Based Defence Mechanisms</h3>
  <p>
    Model‑based approaches exploit mathematical models of system dynamics and expected behaviour to detect and
    mitigate malicious perturbations. In CPS, secure state‑estimation techniques extend classical Kalman filtering
    by explicitly modelling adversarial disturbances or sensor corruptions and by using redundancy across
    measurements to identify and isolate compromised channels. For example, secure‑estimation methods proposed by
    Fawzi and colleagues demonstrate how to reconstruct system states when a subset of sensors or actuators is
    subject to false‑data injection, under suitable sparsity and observability assumptions
    (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03853.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fawzi et&nbsp;al., 2015</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    These methods are attractive in safety‑critical CPS because they build on established control‑theoretic tools,
    can incorporate physical constraints and provide formal guarantees under specified attack models. They are
    particularly relevant for false‑data injection and replay attacks, where the objective is to detect
    inconsistencies between the physical process and the reported measurements. However, model‑based defences rely
    on accurate system models and parameters and may be sensitive to modelling errors, unmodelled disturbances or
    topology changes in large‑scale systems such as smart grids.
  </p>
  <p>
    In industrial contexts, model‑based techniques also extend to specification‑based monitoring, where
    communication patterns, control sequences or process variables are checked against formally defined
    invariants. Deviation from these invariants can signal potential attacks or unsafe conditions. While such
    methods can offer low false‑positive rates when specifications are well understood, they require significant
    upfront engineering effort and may be less flexible in highly dynamic environments.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Data‑Driven and Machine‑Learning‑Based Defence Mechanisms</h3>
  <p>
    Data‑driven approaches use statistical learning and machine‑learning techniques to identify anomalous or
    malicious behaviour in network traffic, host activity, sensor streams or user actions. Supervised
    classification methods, such as random forests, support‑vector machines, gradient‑boosting ensembles and deep
    neural networks, are trained on labelled datasets that distinguish benign from malicious events. Once
    deployed, these models can flag activity resembling known attack patterns. In industrial and CPS settings,
    supervised learning has been applied to detect, for example, command‑injection and denial‑of‑service attacks
    in control networks and IIoT infrastructures
    (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/5/2415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saaidi et&nbsp;al., 2023</a>;
    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376180604_Cyber_Intrusion_detection_in_Industry_40_Data_using_Machine_Learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hassan et&nbsp;al., 2023</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Unsupervised and semi‑supervised techniques are particularly valuable where labelled attack data are scarce
    or incomplete. Clustering algorithms, autoencoders and one‑class classifiers learn a model of normal behaviour
    and report deviations as potential anomalies. This is advantageous in CPS, where deriving comprehensive labels
    for all possible attack scenarios is infeasible, and in SMEs, where ground‑truth incident data may be limited.
    Recent work also explores reinforcement learning and online learning to adapt detection strategies over time
    as environments evolve
    (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404824004747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Madhusudhanan et&nbsp;al., 2024</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite their flexibility, data‑driven methods face challenges related to dataset quality, concept drift and
    explainability. Many published models are trained and evaluated on limited benchmark datasets that may not
    capture the diversity and noise of real‑world industrial or SME environments. High model complexity can make
    it difficult for operators and auditors to understand why a particular alert was raised, which may hinder
    trust and complicate incident response. Careful feature engineering, model selection and validation, together
    with post‑hoc explanation techniques, are therefore critical for practical deployment.
  </p>

  <h3>4.3 Hybrid Defence Mechanisms and Defence‑in‑Depth</h3>
  <p>
    Hybrid approaches seek to combine the strengths of model‑based and data‑driven mechanisms. For example,
    residual signals from observers or state estimators can serve as features for machine‑learning models, allowing
    the integration of physical knowledge with statistical pattern recognition. Similarly, specification‑based
    monitors can be used alongside anomaly‑detection algorithms to provide layered detection, where violation of a
    hard safety constraint triggers immediate intervention while softer anomalies prompt further investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    More broadly, defence‑in‑depth for Industry&nbsp;4.0 and CPS environments entails multiple complementary
    controls across network, host, application and process layers. Network segmentation, secure configuration of
    firewalls and industrial demilitarised zones, hardening of endpoints, strict authentication for remote access
    and continuous monitoring of logs and telemetry form the baseline. Authoritative guidance such as NIST
    Special Publication 800‑82 on industrial control system security and NIST SP&nbsp;800‑53 on security and privacy
    controls provide structured control catalogues and architectural patterns that can be tailored to industrial
    contexts
    (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/82/r2/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIST, 2015</a>;

    On top of these baselines, intrusion‑detection and anomaly‑detection systems tailored to industrial protocols
    and process variables can provide earlier warning of misuse or compromise. Incident‑response runbooks aligned
    with operational and safety requirements are needed to translate detections into effective action.
  </p>

  <h3>4.4 SME‑Appropriate and Governance‑Aligned Mitigation Strategies</h3>
  <p>
    For SMEs, resource constraints and skills gaps limit the feasibility of highly specialised detection
    approaches. Effective defence therefore often focuses on a combination of secure‑by‑default configurations,
    managed security services and targeted capacity building. Practical measures include enforcing multi‑factor
    authentication for critical services, hardening email and web‑gateway configurations, maintaining regular
    backups with offline or immutable copies, and using endpoint‑detection‑and‑response solutions provided by
    trusted vendors. Where possible, SMEs can leverage built‑in security controls and baselines from cloud and
    SaaS providers rather than attempting to engineer bespoke solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cloud and managed‑service providers can play a key role by offering opinionated security baselines, automated
    configuration checks and security‑monitoring dashboards that reduce the operational burden on SMEs. However,
    technical measures need to be complemented by governance mechanisms such as clear assignment of security
    responsibilities, simple incident‑response plans, vendor‑risk management practices and recurring security
    awareness training. Even lightweight interventions – for example, phishing‑simulation campaigns combined with
    focused follow‑up training – can measurably improve user behaviour when sustained over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Across all domains, aligning technical controls with governance frameworks and human‑centric measures is
    crucial. Policies and procedures should be reflected in practical artefacts such as configuration baselines,
    checklists and monitoring rules, and these should be regularly reviewed in change‑advisory or security
    governance forums. In industrial and CPS environments, this alignment must also account for safety and
    availability constraints, ensuring that security mechanisms support rather than hinder core operations. The
    next section discusses emerging challenges and future directions that arise from the interplay of technical
    innovation, threat evolution and human and organisational factors.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Emerging Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
  <p>
    The preceding sections highlight substantive progress in understanding threats, vulnerabilities and defence
    mechanisms in Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, CPS and SMEs. At the same time, several challenges limit the
    effectiveness and generalisability of existing approaches. This section outlines key open issues related to
    datasets and evaluation practice, explainability and human factors, safety‑critical constraints, SME capacity
    and the integration of technical controls with governance and security culture. These challenges suggest a
    multi‑disciplinary research agenda that combines security engineering, data science and organisational
    perspectives.
  </p>

  <h3>5.1 Data and Evaluation Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Many proposed detection mechanisms for industrial networks and CPS are evaluated on a narrow set of benchmark
    datasets or laboratory testbeds that may not reflect the complexity and noise of real‑world deployments.
    Publicly available datasets often focus on specific protocols or attack types and may contain artefacts that
    inadvertently simplify the detection task. In practice, industrial traffic patterns vary across sectors and
    over time, and SMEs may have very different usage profiles from large critical‑infrastructure operators.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is therefore a need for more representative, longitudinal and cross‑domain datasets, as well as
    evaluation methodologies that account for concept drift, imbalanced classes and the operational costs of false
    positives and false negatives. Privacy, safety and commercial‑sensitivity constraints make it difficult to
    share raw industrial or SME telemetry, which motivates research into privacy‑preserving data collection,
    federated learning and synthetic‑data generation techniques that still preserve relevant statistical
    properties.
  </p>

  <h3>5.2 Explainability, Trust and Human Factors</h3>
  <p>
    As data‑driven and hybrid defence mechanisms become more complex, operators, engineers and auditors need to
    understand why a given alert or decision was produced. Black‑box models can hinder incident triage and reduce
    trust in automated detection. Explainable‑AI techniques offer tools to highlight salient features or to provide
    human‑interpretable rationales, but their application to safety‑critical CPS and industrial contexts remains an
    active research area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond technical explainability, human factors influence how controls are configured, monitored and
    maintained. Misconfigurations, insecure workarounds and alert fatigue can undermine even well‑designed
    detection systems. Future work should therefore examine how to design interfaces, workflows and training that
    support effective decision‑making by engineers and non‑specialist staff, and how to embed security practices
    into everyday operational routines. This includes studying security culture, incentives and organisational
    structures in industrial operators and SMEs.
  </p>

  <h3>5.3 Safety‑Critical Constraints and Resilience Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    In CPS and many Industry&nbsp;4.0 settings, safety and availability are primary requirements. Security controls
    must not compromise safe operation or introduce unacceptable downtime. This creates tension between aggressive
    intrusion‑response actions and the need to maintain service continuity. For example, automatically isolating a
    suspected compromised controller may prevent further propagation of an attack but could also disrupt critical
    processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Research on resilience engineering and cyber‑physical resilience seeks to address this tension by designing
    systems that can degrade gracefully under attack, maintain essential functions and recover quickly. Promising
    directions include adaptive security policies that account for system state and mission priorities, and
    co‑design of safety and security mechanisms so that they reinforce rather than conflict with each other.
    Formal methods and digital‑twin environments may support the analysis of complex attack–defence interactions
    without endangering live systems.
  </p>

  <h3>5.4 SME Capacity, Cloud Services and Managed Security</h3>
  <p>
    SMEs face acute capacity constraints in terms of security expertise, budget and time. While they are exposed
    to many of the same threats as larger organisations, their ability to implement and maintain advanced defence
    mechanisms is limited. At the same time, SMEs increasingly rely on cloud platforms and managed services for IT
    infrastructure, business applications and security tooling. This trend creates opportunities to "borrow" good
    security practices via secure‑by‑default configurations, managed detection‑and‑response services and
    platform‑provided security controls.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future work should investigate how to design security baselines, templates and automated configuration checks
    that are tailored to SME needs and are easy to adopt. This includes examining which combinations of provider
    controls and in‑house practices offer the best risk‑reduction per unit effort, and how training and guidance
    can help SMEs make informed choices about cloud and managed‑service offerings. There is also a need to better
    understand contractual and shared‑responsibility aspects, so that security obligations between SMEs and their
    providers are clearly defined and auditable.
  </p>

  <h3>5.5 Integrating Technical Controls with Governance and Security Culture</h3>
  <p>
    Finally, technical defences cannot be fully effective without alignment with governance frameworks and
    security culture. Standards and guidelines such as ISO/IEC&nbsp;27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ENISA
    sectoral guidance provide high‑level control objectives and risk‑management practices, but their
    operationalisation in Industry&nbsp;4.0, CPS and SME contexts remains uneven. Bridging this gap requires
    translating abstract control requirements into concrete artefacts such as configuration baselines,
    policy‑as‑code rules, monitoring dashboards and training curricula.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future research can explore how to embed detection mechanisms and hardening measures into broader
    cyber‑security programmes, including change management, configuration‑control boards and continuous‑improvement
    cycles. Human‑centric interventions – such as role‑based training, behavioural nudges and feedback mechanisms
    – are likely to be important complements to technical controls. Understanding which combinations of controls,
    governance practices and cultural interventions are most effective in different organisational settings remains
    an open question with significant practical relevance.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This working paper has examined cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and defence mechanisms across
    Industry&nbsp;4.0 environments, cyber‑physical systems (CPS) and small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs).
    By adopting a cross‑domain perspective, it has shown that many superficially distinct incidents are underpinned
    by common patterns in attacker behaviour and systemic weaknesses. Ransomware, phishing, credential theft and
    supply‑chain compromise remain pervasive entry points across all three domains, while CPS‑specific attacks
    such as false‑data injection and replay exploits the tight coupling between digital control and physical
    processes. These threats are amplified by structural vulnerabilities, including legacy systems with limited
    security features, insufficient network segmentation, misconfigurations in identity and access management and
    gaps in security monitoring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The analysis of vulnerabilities underscores that technical weaknesses cannot be separated from organisational
    and human factors. In Industry&nbsp;4.0 and CPS deployments, incremental integration of new technologies into
    existing infrastructures often creates complex, heterogeneous environments where asset visibility and
    configuration management are challenging. In SMEs, limited security expertise, under‑resourcing and informal
    governance leave common misconfigurations and risky practices unaddressed. Across domains, incomplete asset
    inventories, unclear responsibility boundaries and weak security culture contribute to persistent exposure,
    regardless of the specific technologies in use.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this backdrop, the paper has reviewed model‑based, data‑driven and hybrid defence mechanisms. In
    safety‑critical CPS, secure state estimation and specification‑based monitoring leverage physical models to
    detect and mitigate false‑data injection and related attacks, offering formal guarantees under explicit
    assumptions. Data‑driven and machine‑learning‑based methods provide flexibility in the face of evolving
    threats and complex environments, particularly when labelled attack data are scarce. Hybrid approaches and
    defence‑in‑depth architectures combine these strands, layering preventive controls, monitoring, detection and
    incident response across network, host, application and process layers.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, the discussion of emerging challenges highlights limitations of current practice. Many
    detection approaches rely on narrow or synthetic datasets, raising questions about their robustness in
    heterogeneous real‑world environments. Black‑box models complicate explanation, triage and auditing, and may
    be difficult to reconcile with the safety and reliability requirements of industrial operators. SMEs face a
    structural capability gap that constrains their ability to adopt sophisticated tools, even as they are exposed
    to many of the same threats as larger organisations. These issues point to the need for research that bridges
    technical innovation with usability, governance and capacity building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, the review suggests that effective cybersecurity in Industry&nbsp;4.0, CPS and SME contexts requires a
    multi‑layered approach that integrates technical controls with governance frameworks and human‑centric
    measures. Secure‑by‑design engineering, opinionated security baselines, policy‑as‑code, continuous monitoring
    and well‑rehearsed incident‑response processes need to be complemented by role‑appropriate training, clear
    assignment of responsibilities and supportive security culture. Future work can build on the insights
    synthesised here by developing and evaluating concrete architectures, datasets and training interventions that
    operationalise these principles in specific organisational settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although this paper is not directly tied to a single case study, its cross‑domain perspective provides a
    foundation for more targeted investigations into human‑centric and governance‑aware security frameworks. In
    particular, the interplay between technical defences, cloud‑based services, organisational processes and end
    users offers fertile ground for research on how to achieve measurable improvements in security posture and
    resilience without overwhelming the people responsible for operating and maintaining complex digital
    infrastructures.
