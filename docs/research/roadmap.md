## Milestones (template)

- **Literature mapping** (themes, gaps, comparative findings)
- **Requirements** (governance + technical controls)
- **Prototype** (policy-as-code guardrails)
- **Evaluation** (case study / expert interviews / audits / simulation)
- **Write-up** (papers + thesis chapters)

## Weekly cadence
