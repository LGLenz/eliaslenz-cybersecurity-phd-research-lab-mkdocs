# Research questions

The project investigates **human-centric policy-as-code (PaC) guardrails** for
cloud and platform services, especially in organisations operating within or
between Germany and the UK.

## RQ1 – Design of human-centric guardrails

> **How can PaC guardrails be designed so that they are both technically
> enforceable and understandable for diverse stakeholders (development, ops,
> security, compliance, management)?**

Key aspects:

- expressing security and compliance requirements as executable policies
- making guardrail behaviour explainable (why something is allowed/blocked)
- balancing strictness with developer experience and productivity

## RQ2 – Alignment with governance and regulation

> **How can guardrails be aligned with regulatory expectations, organisational
> policies and existing governance processes?**

Examples:

- mapping controls to BSI, NIS2, GDPR and sector-specific guidance
- representing risk appetite and escalation paths in guardrails
- supporting multi-cloud and hybrid environments with shared responsibilities

## RQ3 – Evaluation and feedback loops

> **How can the effectiveness and usability of PaC guardrails be evaluated in
> real or realistic settings, and how can the results feed back into design?**

Potential approaches:

- scenario-based walk-throughs and tabletop exercises
- small-scale experiments with practitioners
- analysis of incidents and near-misses
- iterative refinement of guardrails and documentation

## RQ4 – Tooling, automation and LLM assistance

> **What role can automation and large language models (LLMs) play in
> designing, reviewing and maintaining PaC guardrails without undermining
> assurance or accountability?**

Topics include:

- LLM-assisted authoring and refactoring of policies
- automated checking of policy sets for gaps, overlaps and regressions
- human-in-the-loop review workflows
- meta-guardrails for the LLMs themselves

These questions are refined over time as the literature review and empirical
work progress.
