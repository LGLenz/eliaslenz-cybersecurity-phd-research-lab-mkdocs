# Conceptual framework

This page should explain the core concepts and how they connect:

- cloud migration drivers and constraints
- shared responsibility model (IaaS/PaaS)
- governance & assurance (controls, evidence, verification)
- policy-as-code guardrails and default-deny enforcement

## Draft scaffold

1. Problem framing (public sector constraints)
2. Threat model (what goes wrong during/after migration)
3. Control objectives (CIA, compliance, resilience)
4. Mechanisms (identity, network, workload, data)
5. Assurance (logging, monitoring, continuous compliance)
